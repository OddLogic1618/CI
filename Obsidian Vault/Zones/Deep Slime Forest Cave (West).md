Description :: You cannot see the entry anymore. Someone has fixed a torch to the stone here. Without the torch it would be pitchblack here and you couldn't see anything here. But wait? Where does the torch come from? Was somebody in here before you? Why does the Torch still burn? Opposite side of the torch you can see carved letters in the stone. It reads - Array(16).join("wat" - 1)
