Description ::  Eroded and unusable paths dot the impenetrable cliffs that keep the ocean at bay. Crabs with pincers as large as you've ever seen squabble over the rights to prime real estate. A group of walruses is sunning on their stretch while the large bull keeps a lookout.

Mobs :: Armored Crab, Sea Crab, Walrus, Bull Walrus
